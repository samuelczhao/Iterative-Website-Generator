Sure! I can help you with that. Here's an example of how the HTML structure for your Germanizer website could look like, taking into account the goals and design requirements you mentioned:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Germanizer - Learn Elementary German</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#lessons">Lessons</a></li>
        <li><a href="#improvement-calendar">Improvement Calendar</a></li>
        <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <section id="home">
    <div class="hero">
      <h1>Welcome to Germanizer</h1>
      <p>Learn elementary German with ease</p>
      <a href="#lessons" class="cta-button">Get Started</a>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="lessons">
    <h2>Lesson Plans</h2>
    <div class="lesson-card">
      <h3>Lesson 1: Greetings</h3>
      <p>In this lesson, you will learn basic greetings and introductions.</p>
      <a href="#" class="lesson-button">Start Lesson</a>
    </div>
    <div class="lesson-card">
      <h3>Lesson 2: Numbers</h3>
      <p>Learn how to count from 1 to 10 in German.</p>
      <a href="#" class="lesson-button">Start Lesson</a>
    </div>
    <!-- More lesson cards here -->
  </section>

  <section id="improvement-calendar">
    <h2>Improvement Calendar</h2>
    <p>Track your progress and set goals with our improvement calendar.</p>
    <div class="calendar">
      <!-- Calendar implementation here -->
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Germanizer</h2>
    <p>Germanizer is a website dedicated to helping beginners learn elementary German. Our interactive lessons and improvement calendar make it easy to track your progress and achieve your language learning goals.</p>
  </section>

  <footer>

  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, I've structured the website with a header containing a navigation menu, sections for the home, lessons, improvement calendar, and about, and a footer. Each section has its own unique content and styling.

Remember to create a separate CSS file (`styles.css`) to define the styles for the website, including the white and green color scheme you mentioned.

This is just a basic starting point, and you can further enhance the design and functionality based on your specific requirements.
